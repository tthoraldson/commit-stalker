# Commit *STALKER*
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tthoraldson/commit-stalker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tthoraldson/commit-stalker)

Commit Tracker is a full-stack web application that checks if members of a team have made a github commit everyday. It also has a slack-bot to message specific users who haven't committed yet that day. Built in line with the 30 day github challenge sprint.
